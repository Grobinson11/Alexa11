        Click me! I'm a link to help Red Pandas!
        </a>
        
        <p id="PandaInfo">  Red Pandas are amazing! They are one of many pandas that are endangered. Lot's of zoos are trying to help them. Some of them are the San Deigo zoo, Franklin Park zoo, and the Toronto zoo! Red Pandas acctually resemble raccons and are about 42 inches long including their long cute bushy tails! They usually weigh a tiny amount of 14 pounds! Smaller than most medium sized dogs! When you first look at red pandas they look like raccons! Most red pandas that live in the wild live in China, Nepal, Myanmor, and Bhuton. They have to live in a tempeture of 10-25 degrees C. They love to live in rock dens and old hollow trees in the wild. Their habitat is 5,000 to 15,700 ft. high! That is pretty high! Red pandas are slowly going extict because they barely make it to their adulthood! Even though red pandas might look like pandas and raccons. Currently, red pandas are considered members of their own group, which is called the Ailuridae! Pandas help the envioerment because they help keep the population of bamboo at a good ratio! They also help by being food to others so the predetors don't go extict! Helping red pandas is very importent to the world!  </p>
